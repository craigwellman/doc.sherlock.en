!!! warning "Important note"

	CONFIRE SHERLOCK installs among other things a kernel driver that filters access to the hard drive. Because it runs closely with the operation system this can lead to problems due to unexpected system configuration (i.e. future service packs from Windows) which despite extensive testing of CONFIRE SHERLOCK can never be completely avoided. Please make sure you have made a full backup of any important files before and during the use of CONFIRE SHERLOCK. The same applies for updates of the operating system during deactivated protection.
